//! A minimal zls (https://github.com/zigtools/zls) client: process lifecycle, JSON-RPC
//! framing, and just enough of the LSP to answer `textDocument/hover` and
//! `textDocument/definition`.
//!
//! Threading model (read this before touching anything below):
//! - `hover`/`gotoDefinition` are called on the **draw thread**, every frame the mouse
//!   dwells over a token (hover) or on a Ctrl/Cmd+click (gotoDefinition). `hover` must
//!   never block — it only reads a cache and, on a miss, hands a *copy* of the input off to
//!   a background worker. `gotoDefinition` is allowed to block briefly (a few hundred ms).
//! - The reader thread and dispatch-worker thread are the only places that block on zls I/O.
//!   Neither may call `dvui.*` — they only touch their own copied inputs, this struct's
//!   fields (behind `SpinLock`), and `sdk.allocator()`, mirroring the discipline documented
//!   on `pixi`'s `PackJob.zig`.
//! - `bytes` passed into `hover`/`gotoDefinition` is a borrowed slice into the live,
//!   mutable document buffer — copy it before handing it to the background queue.
